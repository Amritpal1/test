This is basically a fork of the project [solitaire-for-android](http://code.google.com/p/solitaire-for-android/) with changes to suit my crazy desires for what I'm looking for in a Solitaire game.

I'd like to add my own type of scoring, which is much more casually focused than either "standard" or "vegas" scoring.

If I'm feeling particularly ambitious, I'll rewrite the render loop to use OpenGL for the board, since I think that would both improve performance and allow me to fix some of the kind of hacky code in there now.

Also, the project uses function names with initial capital letters.  I dislike this, but I'm too lazy to change them all.  As I edit functions I'll rename them to be nicer.

Oh, also, this is an Eclipse project, and will build properly in Eclipse.  So there's that bonus >_>
